# SALES DATA ANALYSIS AND PROCESSING

## Data source
The sales data comes from Kaggle 'Store Sales - Time Series Forecasting' competition, available here: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/store-sales-time-series-forecasting

## Goal of the competition
In this “getting started” competition, you’ll use time-series forecasting to forecast store sales on data from Corporación Favorita, a large Ecuadorian-based grocery retailer.

## This notebook
In this notebook, data is imported, pre-processed and analysed. 

Following methods and plots are employed to analyse the data:
- Interactive map of the shops, to understand the geographical distribution of the shops
- Line plots of (a) oil price data, (b) sales vs oil price data, to understand trends in the data
- Autocorrelation, autocorrelation function and partial autocorrelation plots, to understand trends, seasonality, lags etc.
- Predictions using autoregression
